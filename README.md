# Docker playbook

This desktop application is for people often find themselves building certain sets of docker containers over and over again. Now, you can manage those containers in a playbook fashion with hopefully pleasent UI.<br>
(The application is still actively developed by me and will be bug free in a couple of months.) 

## Setup 

From project root:<br>
`pip install docker`<br>
`npm i`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br>
Don't forget to refresh after window starts.

### `npm run prod`

Runs the app in the production mode.

### `npm run prod`

Runs the app in the development mode without electron.<br/>
Faster option, lets you develop on browser window instead.
